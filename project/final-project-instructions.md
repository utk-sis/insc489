# INSC 489 - Final Project

You will work on a final project **independently**. The goal of the project is to create an interactive visualization project to answer questions you have about a topic of your own choosing. You are free to use Tableau Prep for data preprocessing and Tableau for preliminary analysis, but eventually you have to deliver **a fully-functioned visualization system implemented by using D3.js and JavaScript**. Data processing and visualization via Tableau are optional. 

# Project Milestones

There are a few milestones for the final project.

1. **March 17, Wednesday**: Project Proposal (50 points, it is a part of Assignment 3.)
2. **March 31, Wednesday**: Project Progress Update 1 (25 points, it is a part of Assignment 4.)
3. **April 14, Wednesday**: Project Progress Update 2 (25 points, it is a part of Assignment 5.)
4. **April 29:** Project Presentation (40 points for your presentation, 10 points for your participation in other students’ presentations.)
5. **May 10**: Final Project Report and Project Repo (150 points).

# General Project Requirements

1. At least 3 different views, each containing a different visualization component (e.g. 3 bar charts only count as 1 component).
2. At least 1 of these views must be an "innovative view" that is either (a) a significant extension of an existing visualization component, or (b) a novel visualization component. It cannot be a simple re-use of any visualization component you used in the programming exercises. The extension could consist of an adaptation of the visual encoding, or substantial new interactivity features.
3. Multiple views coordinated with linked highlighting. A click/hover/selection interaction within one view must trigger a change in a different view. At least 2 views need to be linked unidirectionally. (Ideally, linked bidirectionally.)
4. At least 1 UI widgets that allow users to filter the data or update certain views interactively (e.g. dropdown, radio button, range slider, calendar).
5. Include interactive tooltips, in at least one view, that are shown when users hover over marks.

# High-level Criteria

- Visual design: Effectiveness of visualizations and interactions, which should link back to usage scenarios, tasks, and intended audience.
- Level of technical difficulty and quality of implementation.
- Addresses the goals and requirements.
- Quality and clarity of your writing.

# Deliverables

There are several deliverables for your project that will be graded individually to make up your final project score.

## Proposal

You need to describe the title, the motivation, the data, and the initial questions you want to answer through your analysis. The content can be incorporated into your final report.

## Project Progress Updates

You need to submit your project updates twice, along with Assignment 4 and 5.

## Presentation

You will give a 15-minute presentation to show your data, visualizations, and findings in the last class.

## Project Report

You will use a word/pdf document to present your project report. The project is mainly used to present your project background, method, and results. You don't have to include your code in the report but you can include some code snippets to illustrate your methods.

The report should include the following topics. Depending on the project type, the amount of discussion devoted to each will vary:

- **Overview and Motivation**: Provide an overview of the project goals and the motivation for them.
- **Related Work**: Anything that inspired you, such as a paper, a web site, a visualization, or something we discussed in class.
- **Goals and Tasks**: What questions are you trying to answer? How did these questions evolve over the course of the project? What new questions did you consider in the course of your analysis?
- **Data**: Any data manipulation you conducted and give a brief rationale for your data processing.
- **Visualization Design**: Describe your visualization design and your design rationale.
- **Visualization Results**: Present your visualization results with screenshots

**You are expected to provide high-quality and readable code in your project report. Provide comments for your code when necessary.**

## Project Repo

You need submit your code for implementing the visualization system to your project GitHub repo. 

# Grading

Your final project is worth 300 points and 30% of your final grade. The final project will be graded for each deliverable. The grading criteria for each deliverable will be provided when the assignment is available.
